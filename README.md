Iterating over historical cryptocurrency data of the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap, we generated polynomial regression models based on the n combinations via n-gram iterations of alphabetically sorted cryptocurrency training data. To determine best performing model, each model was tested against all 50 cryptocurrency training datas and aggregated together based on a weighting of size of the coin's test data versus size of conglomerate testing data.
